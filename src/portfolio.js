Additionally, I collaborated in agile sprints, participated in daily standups, and used tools like Git and GitHub for version control. I also conducted browser compatibility testing and assisted in refining front-end logic for better maintainability. This experience solidified my foundation in frontend development and prepared me for full-stack roles.`,
